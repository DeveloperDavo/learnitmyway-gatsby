# Learn it my way

[![Front‑End_Checklist followed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Front‑End_Checklist-followed-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/)

This is the source code for https://www.learnitmyway.com and is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Originally I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator but I later changed to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). 
The layout and styles originate from the [Ananke](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme.

Have a look at [How I release updates to my personal website](https://www.learnitmyway.com/how-i-release-updates-to-my-personal-website/) for more information on the tools, processes and practices I use.
