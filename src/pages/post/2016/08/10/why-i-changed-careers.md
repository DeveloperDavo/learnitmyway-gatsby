A long story short, I started programming for the first time whilst completing my thesis. 
I was required to write an algorithm for a mathematical model, which I enjoyed so much that I decided to take a break 
after completing my degree and teach myself computer science before committing to a job. It very quickly became 
apparent that this was the direction I wanted my career to go in and I have five reasons for making that change.

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>The amount of innovation happening</strong><br /> 
    With the opportunities available to us to today it has never been easier for people to make and learn new things. 
    Examples that come to mind are self-driving cars and augmented reality. 
    Developing software brings me closer to this excitement and also keeps my brain fit so I can keep up with a world 
    <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that is changing exponentially.</a>
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    <strong>The ability to see the results of your hard work</strong><br /> 
    By this I mean the feeling every developer gets when they get a new feature working and get to see results 
    almost instantaneously. One of the first times I experienced this was when I got a basic version of my algorithm 
    working for my <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/Paperboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thesis</a>. I remember writing 
    loads of spaghetti code with no idea about design and after fiddling around a bit I clicked on ‘plot’ and a graph 
    popped up on the screen depicting my results. Believe me, this was a really exciting moment!
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    <strong>The ability to apply what you learn straight after learning it</strong><br /> 
    There have been numerous occasions where I have read, watched or listened to something new
    and I am able to apply this at work or in my own projects. 
    An example is <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/DesignPatterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design patterns</a>. 
    As soon as you are able to use and recognise them programming becomes a lot more elegant.
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    <strong>The team and work atmosphere that we are exposed to</strong><br /> 
    With Agile processes such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, teams are able to work extremely effectively. 
    As a result, individual members are able to learn more, the team is able to interact better with one another 
    and productivity increases dramatically.
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    <strong>The people that are attracted to the profession</strong><br /> 
    There are so many good and inspiring developers out there that are genuinely interested in helping others. 
    Just have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/trending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trending open source projects on GitHub</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Final Thoughts
So those are the reasons I made the change. I don't regret the decision at all and can highly recommend doing it.
