This is how I made it happen._

**I knew exactly 
<a href="https://www.learnitmyway.com/2016/08/10/why-i-changed-careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
why I wanted to change careers</a>.** 
I conveyed this in every cover letter, at careers fairs and in interviews. 
I figured if I could convince myself then I could convince my future employer.

**I presented all the relevant experience I had.** 
For me, it was the engineering background and former work experience as a consultant. 
I also listed 
<a href="https://www.learnitmyway.com/2016/11/11/learning-material-software-development/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning material</a> in
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ZNcIeUNLoLbHpZNU5JWWhQM0E/view?usp=sharing" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener">my CV</a> 
and created a <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub profile</a> to 
offer some proof that I had completed or was in the middle of completing further education. 
I should add that back in 2015 I didn't have this blog and my list of learning material, my CV and 
my GitHub profile had a lot less to show!

**I went to a career fair with the goal to learn as much as I could about each company that was there.** 
I actually went there looking for a job as a structural engineer and just for fun I decided to get to know the 
IT companies that were there as well. It was only afterwards that I made the decision to become a software developer.

At the career fair, I got to know three IT companies and applied at all three, and got an interview at all three. 
For the first company, I passed the first interview but I didn’t pass the programming exercise. 
The second company offered me an internship for three months with one day off to study and the third company 
offered me a permanent position. I took the internship because I knew the day off would be a great opportunity to 
bridge my knowledge gap quicker. 
The happy ending to this story is that the same company offered me a permanent position, 
which I started straight after completing my internship.
