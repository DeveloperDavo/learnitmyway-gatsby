_In this article, I share a list of the recommended resources that have helped me learn React._

<!--more-->

Before starting with these resources you should have some experience with JavaScript. 
In particular, you should feel comfortable using ES6 syntax (eg. arrow functions and classes). 
Trying these resources before you are familiar with JavaScript will just frustrate you. 
If you feel that you are lacking some (or a lot of) knowledge I would recommend having a look
at <a href="https://www.learnitmyway.com/learn-javascript-with-these-resources/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">Learn JavaScript with these resources</a>. 
Otherwise, the resources below can be completed in the order they are given. Enjoy!

### Core React skills

* Really simple tutorial on React
* Describes the differences compared to plain JavaScript

**<a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutorial: Intro To React</a>**

* Be aware that the syntax is not as modern as it could be.
* Make sure you do the improvements at the end! You are welcome to compare your solutions with <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/intro-to-react-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mine</a>. 

**<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React docs - quick start</a>**

* Start by implementing the example in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking in React</a>
on your own and then read the documentation from the beginning. This will show you where your gaps are.
* I would recommend coming back to the advanced guide once you have a bit more practice with React.

Once you have completed the resources above I would recommend practising the concepts by starting a project of your own. It can be something similar to 
<a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/my-movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Movies</a>, which is a project I started for the same reason.
