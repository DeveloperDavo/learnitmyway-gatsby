_I have a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and a Master of Structural Engineering. 
I decided to work as a software engineer. So, was it worth studying for six years?_

Unfortunately, I don’t have a definite answer to this question and here are my four reasons why:

<ol>
  <li>
    The master&#8217;s degree was extremely challenging for me. 
    As a result I got used to studying many hours a week. 
    I actually thought I was going to fail and have to quit before the first semester was over 
    but I decided to push through it and ended up doing ok. 
    Every semester after that was much better than the one before and I ended up doing really well. 
    This noticeable improvement allowed me to gain confidence in my own abilities.
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    I can hardly remember what I did in my bachelor’s degree. 
    I remember having a rule that I would never study past 5pm and never on weekends. 
    What did I do with all that free time!? 
    I remember having a lot of fun during that time and I definitely was able to gain some life experience 
    and meet people who will always be a part of my life.
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    Studying not only taught me how to learn but it also taught me how <em>not</em> to learn. 
    A lot of what I studied was too abstract. I couldn’t really apply what I was learning. 
    <a href="https://www.learnitmyway.com/2016/11/11/learning-material-software-development/" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching myself software development</a> has been much more effective 
    because I can apply what I learn straight away, which never really happened as a structural engineer.
  </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
    A degree is an official proof that you can accomplish something and the results you achieve are somewhat objective. 
    It gives you a sense of credibility, which is important when applying for a job.
  </li>
  <br/>
</ol>

As you can see, I can’t really decide if studying was worth it. 
It definitely wasn’t a waste of time but I still don’t feel it was a very effective use of my time. 
I will always wonder if I could have gained similar life experiences doing something else in a shorter period. 
It’s also interesting to speculate what would have been had I studied computer science instead…
